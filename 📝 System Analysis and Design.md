| [[Use Case Diagram]]      | describing what system does without describing how                                                                                                                                                   |

| [[Physical dfd]]          | How system is implemented, Same as logical dfd but shows more technical view                                                                                                                         |
| [[Activity diagram]]      | illustrated overall flow of activities                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Sequence diagram]]      | sequence of activities and interactions between classes or objects over time                                                                                                                         |
| [[Communication diagram]] | Describes the interactions of two or more things in the system that perform a behavior that is more than any one of the things can do alone. Same info as [[Sequence diagram]] but difficult to read |
| [[Class diagram]]         | classes and relationships                                                                                                                                                                            |
